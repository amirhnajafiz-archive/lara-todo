# Lara-Todo

This is a course that I took at Udmey, to create a website with Laravel and Vue.js

## Start
First we need to download and setup <b>Composer</b>. After that we setup the project:
```shell
composer create-project laravel/laravel TodoList
```

After that we need to require the laravel ui:
```shell
composer require laravel/ui
```

And for the Vue we need to install artisan vue:
```shell
php artisan ui vue
```
